For lovers of fortified data structures here is a version of a list [arrayList] that is well customised for a number of operations. It is built on top of the javascript array with the following fuctionalities.  
    a. adding at any index easily  
    b. removing at any index easily  
    c. deleting a provided element with a number of its copies or not.  
    d. getting an element at an index  
    e. getting the index of a given element  
    f. checking if an element is already part of the list  

It is similar to Java array list.  

Your contribution will be of much help  

Enjoy.
